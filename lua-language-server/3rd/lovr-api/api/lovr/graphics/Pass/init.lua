    Pass objects are used to record commands for the GPU.  Commands can be recorded by calling
    functions on the Pass.  After recording a set of passes, they can be submitted for the GPU to
    process using `lovr.graphics.submit`.

    Pass objects are **temporary** and only exist for a single frame.  Once `lovr.graphics.submit`
    is called to end the frame, any passes that were created during that frame become **invalid**.
    Each frame, a new set of passes must be created and recorded.  LÃ–VR tries to detect if you use a
    pass after it's invalid, but this error checking is not 100% accurate at the moment.

    There are 3 types of passes.  Each type can record a specific type of command:

    - `render` passes render graphics to textures.
    - `compute` passes run compute shaders.
    - `transfer` passes can transfer data to/from GPU objects, like `Buffer` and `Texture`.
