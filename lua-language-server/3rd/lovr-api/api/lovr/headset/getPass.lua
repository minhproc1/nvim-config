    The same Pass will be returned until `lovr.headset.submit` is called.

    The first time this function is called during a frame, the views of the Pass will be initialized
    with the headset view poses and view angles.

    The pass will be cleared to the background color, which can be changed using
    `lovr.graphics.setBackgroundColor`.

    The pass will have a depth buffer.  If `t.headset.stencil` was set to a truthy value in
    `lovr.conf`, the depth buffer will use the `d32fs8` format, otherwise `d32f` will be used.

    If `t.headset.antialias` was set to a truthy value in `lovr.conf`, the pass will be
    multisampled.
